Hi, my name is Bronson (Moonseong) Jeong and I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA, advised by Professor [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/). My undergraduate training is in Mathematics of Computation and Physics, also at UCLA. My interest primarily lies in developing scalable models to make sense of large, complex and often noisy data, a pursuit well-suited to computational medicine. This field is particularly fascinating due to its diverse data types, ranging from Electronic Health Records to DNA sequences, all demanding domain-specific explanation and analysis. More specifically, my research focuses on understanding the genetic basis of complex traits (such as disease, height, etc.) at the population scale by linking genomics with datasets of diverse modalities.

During my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Professor [Alice Shapley](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~aes/) on a research project related to high-redshift galaxies [[paper]](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abba7a). This experience was an early step in my ongoing journey of exploring the complexities of large data in various forms.

* Train-free foundation model for high-dimensional phenotypes in biobanks
* Integrating EHR records and multimodal data for precision care
* Investigating opioid prescription patterns for addiction prevention
* Coalescent theoretic limit of reference-based local ancestry inference (LAI)
