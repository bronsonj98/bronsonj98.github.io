### About
Hi, my name is Bronson (Moonseong) Jeong and I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA, advised by Professor [**Sriram Sankararaman**](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/). I work on methods at the interface of **statistical genetics**, **machine learning**, and **clinical informatics**, with an emphasis on models that scale to **biobank-size cohorts** and remain **interpretable and reproducible**. Specifically, my research is focused on understanding the genetic basis of complex traits (such as height or diseases). As an undergrad, I studied **Mathematics of Computation** and **Physics** also at UCLA, and led data analysis in an astronomical spectroscopy project with Professor [**Alice Shapley**](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~aes/). This was an experience that shaped my approach to **signal detection** and **uncertainty quantification** in large, noisy datasets.

### Research interests
- **Population-scale genetic inference:** Efficient estimators using **summary statistics** to recover architecture and population parameters when raw data are constrained.  
- **High-dimensional phenotypes:** “Train-free” representations (RAPTOR) to make medical imaging and other complex phenotypes usable across tasks without heavy compute.  
- **EHR × genomics integration:** Methods that combine clinical records with genomic features for **interpretable** risk prediction and cohort discovery.
- **Opioid prescription data:** Preventing opioid addiction by disentangling the California CURES database for controlled substances.
- **Theory for ancestry-aware models:** Coalescent-theoretic limits and robustness for reference-based local ancestry inference.
