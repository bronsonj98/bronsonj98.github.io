Hi, my name is Bronson (Moonseong) Jeong and I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA, advised by Professor [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/). My undergraduate training is in Mathematics of Computation and Physics, also at UCLA. My interest primarily lies in developing models to make sense of complex data, a pursuit well-suited to genomics. This field is particularly fascinating due to its diverse data types, ranging from Electronic Health Records to DNA sequences, all demanding explanation and analysis. More specifically, my research focuses on understanding the genetic basis of complex traits (such as disease, height, etc.) at the population scale.

During my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Professor [Alice Shapley](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~aes/) on research related to high-redshift galaxies. This experience was an early step in my ongoing journey of exploring the complexities of data in various forms.

Current research topics:
* Scalable summary statistics-based population parameter inference in biobanks
* Coalescent theoretic limit of reference-based local ancestry inference (LAI)
* Understanding opioid prescription patterns
* Deep-learning based latent embeddings of high-dimensional phenotypes in biobanks
